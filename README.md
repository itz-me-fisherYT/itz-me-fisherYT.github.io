## 🚀 Overview

**ItzFisher.org** is my official gamer portfolio website with a dark Minecraft-style pixel aesthetic.  
It now includes **live dynamic profiles** for Discord and Roblox (main + alt accounts), along with my work on **TicketForge**, **Help Bot 2.0**, and future projects.

The site is fully built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with interactive animations, particles, music, and API integrations.
